# The Game

Binal Bantasy is a role-playing game inspired by the
best JRPGs of the 80s and 90s. It draws most inspiration
from franchises such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.

The game features the following:
- Overworld
- Towns
- Dungeons
- Boss Monsters
- Turn-Based Combat
- Leveling
- Items
- Money

## Overworld

The overworld is essentially a zoomed-out view of the map.
All icons in the overworld are representational. 

For example, towns, dungeons, and geography are all 
represented on the overworld. Interacting with town
and/or dungeon icons will take you to a to-scale 
map of that town and the player will be able to navigate
those locations.

## Towns

Towns are areas that are safe-zones where the player can
rest to replinish helath, talk to characters, and purchase
items to be used in the overworld. Players may also save
their game in the towns only.

## Dungeons

Dungeons are where the player must overcome challenges in
order to beat the game. There will be three dungeons which
the player can access. Each will reward the player with 1/3
required items needed to unlock the final boss and beat the
game.

## Boss Monsters

Boss mosters will be displayed visibly rather than through 
random encounters. They are larger and more difficult than 
regular enemy encounters. 

## Turn-Based Combat

The way that the player will interact with and defeat enemies
will be through a turn-based battle system. That is, that
the player will select from a variety of menu options to 
designate attacks rather than real-time action.

## Leveling

The player will gain experience as they defeat monsters. 
This will allow the player to grow stronger. The player 
will need to level up to get strong enough to defeat 
the boss mosnters.

## Items

Players will be able to purchase items in towns as well as
discover them within the overworld and dungeons. Items can
also be purchased.

Items include:
- Keys
- Health Potions
- Armor
- Weapons


## Money

The player will purchase items with money. Money will
be aquired by defeating enemies in the overworld and 
in dungeons. The amount will be limited to the type
of enemy with a random fluxuation.
